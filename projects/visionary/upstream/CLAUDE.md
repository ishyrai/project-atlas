## Project

**Visionary Mission Control**

A custom web-based project management and agent orchestration platform for the user's OpenClaw multi-agent system. Upgrades the current static Node.js dashboard into a full interactive operations center — inspired by Benoît's "Visionary" platform but adapted for the user's 8-agent cybersecurity/builder/investment setup.

**Core Value:** **One place to see everything your agents are doing, dispatch work, and manage projects — without juggling Telegram/WhatsApp/terminal.**

## Technology Stack

## Recommended Stack
### Core Runtime & Server
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why |
|------------|---------|---------|-----|
| Node.js | 22 LTS | Runtime, HTTP server, SSE, file I/O | Native `http` module replaces Express. Node 22 adds `crypto.randomUUID()`, `fs.glob()`, stable `node:test`, global `structuredClone()`, `URLSearchParams`. Zero-dep server is viable and maintainable. |
| `node:http` | stdlib | HTTP server, API routes, SSE streaming | `http.createServer` with manual routing via URL pathname matching. No Express needed for around 15 routes. |
| `node:child_process` | stdlib | OpenClaw CLI dispatch | `execFile('openclaw', [...args])` for agent dispatch. Use `spawn` for long-running tasks where you need streaming stdout for real-time progress. Always use `execFile` over `exec` to avoid shell injection. |
| `node:crypto` | stdlib | UUID generation | `crypto.randomUUID()` replaces the `uuid` npm package for task/agent IDs. |
| `node:fs` | stdlib | Workspace file reading | Read briefs, audits, memory chunks from `~/.openclaw/workspace`. Use `fs.readFileSync` for small files, `fs.createReadStream` for large ones. |
| `node:path` | stdlib | Path resolution | Safe cross-platform path joining for workspace files. |
| `node:url` | stdlib | URL parsing, query params | `new URL(req.url, base)` for route matching and query parameter extraction. |
### Database
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why |
|------------|---------|---------|-----|
| better-sqlite3 | latest | SQLite binding | **The only npm dependency.** Synchronous API eliminates callback hell. 10x faster than node-sqlite3 for single-connection workloads. Native C++ addon, battle-tested. Prepared statements compile once, execute many times. `.transaction()` wrapper handles BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK automatically. |
| SQLite | 3.45+ (bundled) | Persistent storage | Single-file database. WAL mode enables concurrent readers without blocking writes. Perfect for single-user dashboard with one writer (server) and one reader (SSE polling). |
### Frontend (Embedded SPA)
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why |
|------------|---------|---------|-----|
| Vanilla JS | ES2022+ | All client-side logic | No React, no Vue, no build step. Template literal HTML embedded in `server.js`. Modern browsers support everything needed: `fetch`, `EventSource`, Drag and Drop API, CSS Grid, Custom Properties, `structuredClone`. |
| HTML5 Drag and Drop API | native | Kanban board | `draggable="true"`, `dragstart`/`dragover`/`drop` events. No library needed for column-to-column task movement. |
| EventSource (SSE) | native | Real-time updates | Built-in browser API. Auto-reconnects with exponential backoff. Sends `Last-Event-ID` header on reconnect so server can replay missed events. |
| CSS Custom Properties | native | Theming, ops-center aesthetic | Define color palette as variables: `--bg-primary`, `--accent-green`, `--text-mono`. Monospace stack: `'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', 'SF Mono', monospace`. |
### Real-Time Updates (SSE Architecture)
| Component | Implementation | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Server endpoint | `GET /api/events` with `Content-Type: text/event-stream` | Native HTTP response streaming. No WebSocket library needed. SSE is HTTP-native, works through proxies, and auto-reconnects. |
| Event format | `id: {monotonic_id}\nevent: {type}\ndata: {json}\n\n` | Standard SSE format. Monotonic IDs enable replay on reconnect. Event types: `task_update`, `agent_status`, `notification`, `activity`. |
| Client | `new EventSource('/api/events')` | Zero-dependency. Browser handles reconnection, `Last-Event-ID` header. 3-second default retry, configurable via `retry:` field from server. |
| Event store | `events` table in SQLite | Append-only. Server queries `WHERE id > ?` using `Last-Event-ID` to replay missed events on reconnect. Prune events older than 24h via cron. |
| Keep-alive | `: keepalive\n\n` every 30s | SSE comment line prevents connection timeout. No data payload, just keeps the TCP connection alive. |

| JSON body parsing | `req.on('data')` + `JSON.parse()` | `body-parser` |
| Deep clone | `structuredClone()` | `lodash.cloneDeep` |
| File watching (dev) | `node --watch server.js` | `nodemon` |
| CLI execution | `child_process.execFile/spawn` | `execa` |
| Environment vars | `process.env` | `dotenv` (if .env not needed) |
| Path manipulation | `node:path` | -- |

| Event handling | `node:events` EventEmitter | -- |
| Testing | `node:test` + `node:assert` | `jest`, `mocha` |
## Alternatives Considered
| Category | Recommended | Alternative | Why Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| HTTP server | `node:http` | Express | Adds 30+ transitive deps. For around 15 API routes, native is simpler and this project mandates zero deps. |
| Database | better-sqlite3 | Convex / Turso | Convex requires account + cloud. Turso adds network dependency. SQLite = single file, works offline, zero infrastructure. |
| Real-time | SSE via native HTTP | WebSocket (`ws`) | `ws` is an npm dep. SSE is HTTP-native, auto-reconnects, works through proxies, simpler server code. One-way server-to-client is sufficient for this dashboard. |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS | React/Vue/Svelte | Build step, npm deps, bundle size. Embedded template literal SPA has zero build tooling. For a single-user ops dashboard, vanilla is fast enough. |
| Templating | Template literals | EJS/Handlebars | Additional dep. JS template literals do the same thing natively. |
| Drag and Drop | HTML5 DnD API | SortableJS | Another dep. Native DnD API handles kanban column moves. Touch support can be added with pointer events if needed later. |
| Routing | if/else chain | URLPattern API | URLPattern is still experimental in Node 22. Simple pathname matching is sufficient for around 15 routes. |
## Installation
# The entire dependency tree
# That is it. One dependency.
## Development Tooling (optional, zero-dep)
# File watching for dev (Node 22 native)
# Testing (Node 22 native)
# No build step, no bundler, no transpiler
## Performance Considerations
| Concern | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| SQLite write contention | WAL mode + `busy_timeout = 5000`. Single writer is fine for single-user app. |
| SSE memory per client | Each client holds one `res` object in `sseClients` Set. the user is the only user, so 1-3 connections max. |
| Large SPA HTML | Template literal is served from memory (no disk read). Gzip not needed for single user on localhost. |
| OpenClaw CLI latency | `execFile` is non-blocking (spawns child process). Use `spawn` for streaming long tasks. |
| Event table growth | Prune events older than 24h daily. `DELETE FROM events WHERE created_at < ?` in a scheduled interval. |

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd-quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
